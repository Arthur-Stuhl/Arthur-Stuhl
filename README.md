### Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 👋

👋 Hello, I'm Arthur Stuhl!

I'm a 34-year-old Swiss-French tech enthusiast with a penchant for all things Candy. Energized by technology and fueled by cocoa and coffee, I've navigated the dynamic world of server administration, contributing my skills to both tech giants like SUSE and Google, as well as smaller, innovative companies.

🚀 What I Do

- Over the years, I've honed my expertise in server administration, tackling challenges in both large corporations and nimble startups.
- I thrive in dynamic environments and am always up for a coding challenge.

💡 What I'm Into

- When not immersed in server rooms, you can catch me indulging my sweet tooth with a bit of Candy. 🍫
- Balancing my energetic side with occasional bouts of laziness, I believe in the power of a good break to recharge.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and don't hesitate to reach out for a coding discussion or to share your favorite Candy recommendations!!
